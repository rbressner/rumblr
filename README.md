# Rumblr

The goal of this app was to build a blog with a theme of my choice. 

I chose the theme "Conspiracy Theories" because I really enjoy hearing what people have to say about them and felt a platform to express those ideas could be a fun and safe space to speak about them. 

The site opens with a login/sign-up option:

If you are signing up for the first time, you have the option of entering via Facebook or with a signup form:

Which would then bring you to the Profile page and blog feed - as well as the favicon being changed to the user's profile picture:
